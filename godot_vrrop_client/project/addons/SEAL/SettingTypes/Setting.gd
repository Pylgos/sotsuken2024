extends RefCounted

##Base class for settings, note that this class is ONLY meant to be inherited from. Using this class as it is, is undefined.
##Has common functions and variables that is used for all setting types.
##Also stores some info that is used during the visualisation process, but that needs to be serialized for use when the setting definitions are not available.

##For an example on how to set up a basic setting, see IntSetting
##For an example on how to set up a more complex setting with a non primitive type, see KeySetting
class_name Setting

##The name that the setting goes by in code and in GSON. 
##Note: this is the identifier for the setting name in the translation table if translating is enbled for the project.[br] 
##The translated name will then be visible in the settings interface.
var identifier:String

##Which visual setting group this setting should be grouped by when it is visualized for the end user.
##Note: this is the identifier for the setting group in the translation table if translating is enbled for the project.
var _group:String

##Internal variable that is unsafe. You should probably use set_value() and get_value() methods instead.
##Do not use unless you know what you are doing and using proper protection.
var _value:
	set(val):
		if call("is_value_valid", val):
			_value = val
			on_setting_changed.emit()
		else:
			SEAL.logger.err("Value of setting with identifier '" + identifier + "' is not valid. Not setting")

##Settings have a type that must be unique. See any of the built in settings for examples.
##Note: New settings must be registred during the startup sequence before any deserialization is done.
var setting_type:String

##The visual tooltip that should be shown in the settings dialog.
var tooltip:String

##Mostly internal value that is read only, set from the internal constructor.
##Should never be serialized and doing so causes bugs.
var _locked:
	set(val):
		if _locked != null:
			SEAL.logger.err("_locked is read only.")
		_locked = val

##Read only, set from the internal constructor
##Never serialized
var default_value:
	set(val):
		if default_value != null:
			SEAL.logger.err("default value can only be set from the constructor.")
		default_value = val


##Checks whether two values is equal to eachother in the context of this setting, mostly used for the color setting(WIP) since the equals operator on godot colors are fiddely. 
##Note: Can be overridden if needed, but has a default implementation that is generally working for mosttypes.
var values_are_equal_method := func(value1, value2)->bool: 
	return value1==value2

##Dictionary of String:Callable where the string is the 'setting_type' and the Callables takes a dict with GSON info and returns a valid, locked setting.
static var create_locked_collection_from_GSON_methods:={}

##Signal that is emitted whenever the setting is changed, either from code or visually.
signal on_setting_changed

##identifier: Should be internationally readable, UTF-8-coded and not using spaces since this is the identifier used in the GSON file. (See Setting.identidfier for more info)
##group: The visual group that this settings should be visualised alongside with in the settings dialog. E.g "Sounds", "Graphics", etc.
##tooltip: The visual tooltip that should be shown in the settings dialog.
##default_value: The default value that the setting should revert to visually and has initially when the setting is first created, setting value is set to this before any is loaded from a GSON file or the like, and if no value is serialized into this setting, it has this value until somebody changes it, either in code or visually.
##setting_type: The type of setting that should be used. See any of the built in settings for examples. Usually hidden by a sub class.
##__locked: Internal parameter for locking the setting. When a setting is loaded from a GSON only, we set this to true to make sure the program can't read settings that has not been validated. Usually nobydy should need to touch this ;)
