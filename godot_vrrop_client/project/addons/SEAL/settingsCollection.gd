## SettingCollections can either be defined in code, such as in "res://tests/Settings testing.tscn" or generated from a raw GSON file.
## The former is the standard and should always be used when you want to use the settings to control code.
## The latter is used to change settings while this code isn't loaded, like in game launchers, outside mod environments etc.
## This means that the settings are inferred from the GSON code, which may include typos, malware or whatever.
## When using this mode, all the validation has to be done by you, while the former handles all of that for you. 

#TODO: Make the user can conviniently access global settingsCollections as singletons... for now the simplest solution is to just add them as a property to a singleton, or to the SEAL autoload...

##They also MUST have their identifier as the key in the dictionary.

##Saves the settings collection to a GSON file.
